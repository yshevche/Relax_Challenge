    "Inititally I created a column that counted the amount of logins a user had made. This summarized the users that had used the product the most in comparision to those that only made an account. I also created an adoption column that in binary terms yes(1) and no(0), labeled individuals that had logged in three consecutive times over a seven day period. I looked at some descriptive statistics to compare the different groups of categories and it stood out to me that 25% opted in for the mailing list of this company. Looking at a correlation plot it was interesting to see that there was a 52% correlation between a invited_by_user_id and ORG_INVITE. There was also a 47% correlation between enabled_for_marketing_drip and opted_in_to_mailing_list. Overall it was interesting to uderstand the distribution of the data and identifying patterns. "

I split the data in training/testing split of 75/25. The models that I used wher mostly out of the box: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Classifier. \n",

In light of the modeling results, it would be beneficial to focus on increasing interest in the mailing list and enhancing support for existing clients who may promote the product to others."
